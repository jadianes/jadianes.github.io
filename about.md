This one is a blog about those topics that I find exciting such as **Data Analysis**, **Knowledge Discovery**, and **Scalability** of distributed software systems. But over all it is about how to overcome **the gap** between data analysis and software engineering in order to build **data products**. Therefore we will talk about technologies such as `Solr` and `Lucene`, the 'R' and 'Python' ecosystems, or 'Spark'. But also about integrating them into enterprise software systems using 'Java', Spring', 'Flask', 'AngularJS', 'D3', etc.  

Shall we discuss these topics any further? Just contact me.

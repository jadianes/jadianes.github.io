This one is a blog about those topics that I find exciting such as [**Data Analysis**](http://jadianes.me/categories/data-analysis/), [**Scalability**](http://jadianes.me/categories/architecture/) of distributed software systems, or [**Software Engineering**](http://jadianes.me/categories/management/) best practices. But over all it is about how to overcome **the gap** between data analysis and software engineering in order to build **data products**. Therefore we will talk about technologies such as `Solr` and `Lucene`, the `R` and `Python` ecosystems, or `Spark` and `Hadoop`. But also about integrating them into enterprise software systems using `Java`, `Spring`, `Python`, `Flask`, `AngularJS`, `D3`, etc.  

Shall we discuss these topics any further? Just contact me.

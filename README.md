# Mind the gap  
This one is a blog about those topics that I find exciting such as **Data Analysis**, **Knowledge Discovery**, and **Scalability** of distributed software systems. But over all it is about how to overcome **the gap** between data analysis and software engineering in order to build **data products**. Therefore we will talk about technologies such as `Solr` and `Lucene`, the 'R' and 'Python' ecosystems, or 'Spark'. But also about integrating them into enterprise software systems using 'Java', Spring', 'Flask', 'AngularJS', 'D3', etc.

Pixyll is a simple, beautiful theme for Jekyll that emphasizes content rather than aesthetic fluff. It's mobile _first_, fluidly responsive, and delightfully lightweight.

It's pretty minimal, but leverages large type and drastic contrast to make a statement, on all devices.

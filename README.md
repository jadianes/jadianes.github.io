# Being a soloist
This one is a blog about information technologies, and about those IT topics that I find exciting such as **Data Analysis**, **Knowledge Discovery**, or **Enterprise Systems**. But over all it is about **autonomous** and **quick** ways of **starting up** things. Therefore we will talk and use technologies such as `GitHub`, `Jekyll`, `jsFiddle`, `knitr`, the `R` ecosystem, `Python`, `yhat`, etc.

Pixyll is a simple, beautiful theme for Jekyll that emphasizes content rather than aesthetic fluff. It's mobile _first_, fluidly responsive, and delightfully lightweight.

It's pretty minimal, but leverages large type and drastic contrast to make a statement, on all devices.

This Jekyll theme was crafted with <3 by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com)
